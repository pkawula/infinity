Experimental Symfony CRUD using Vue and power of Symfony 5+

## Why?
Because EasyAdmin annoys me sometimes.

After working a bit with Laravel Nova and EA,
I realized that I do not enjoy writing everything server-side.

On the other side Laravel is not a good framework, since it's extremely
messy and uses practices I do not condone. As such I've decided to
attempt to combine the two.

Greatness of clean code and good practices of Symfony
and some stuff from Laravel Nova I guess.

EA lacks a lot of features, which I'm going to try to fix in this attempt
while keeping it nice and neat, on top of being a OPA running on top of
Symfony.

## Stability and features

Currently in trial phase, no stability guarantees will be made.
Only PHP8.1+ with newest Vue available and TypeScript.

See current and planned features in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)

## Setup

Install the bundle, then follow the instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
